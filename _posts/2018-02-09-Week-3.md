**Week 3**

The week I didn't really use the online shop. Today I mainly was trying to fix my blog. And again, like last week, I used the help of my friends and Mr Tansley, as well. I managed to get the writing a different colour to last year. And i also managed to get a working wallpaper. I really like it. Next week I hope to do something similar to the same standard as this week.
