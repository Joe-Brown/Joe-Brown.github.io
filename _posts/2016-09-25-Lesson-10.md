  <tr>
    <td>As you can see I went over my target which means next lesson I need to make my target harder. The thing that limited my learning the most was probably the amount of background chat there was. I find it hard to concentrate when there is a lot of noise in the background.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will make my target harder and maybe I will do some codecademy at home as well where I am in a concentrated environment. This would be beneficial because then my work will be faster and I won't find the task so difficult.</td>
