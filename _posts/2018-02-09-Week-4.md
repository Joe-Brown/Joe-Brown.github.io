Week 4

This week I again did a bit on my blog, but the main part of the lesson was adding a new section to my online shop. We added buying and selling the stock. I think the main skills I used today were, creativity and I also managed to learn how to work well together. Both of these things, i use often in my IT work. Next week i am going to try and do these things again.
