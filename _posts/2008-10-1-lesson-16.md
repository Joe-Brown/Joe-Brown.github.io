    <td>Today I learned the same way that I have done for the last few weeks. I have thought of it logically. This helped a lot as it also improves your sense of what's not and is going to happen in not only coding but life.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of my learning came when I had to write a massive chunk of code. But I soon found out that I had done all of the correct code but had added one to many ':â€™. So a habit that would save me time is re-reading my work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week, I am going to thoroughly read my work once I think I am finished. This will improve my learning as it will give me more time to do other questions.</td>
