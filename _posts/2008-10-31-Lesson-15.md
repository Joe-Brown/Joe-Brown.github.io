  <tr>
    <td>The way I learned today was mostly by logic. This was helpful and effective as it not only encourages understanding of coding but also encourages logic in real life. Another method that I used today was by using the previous skills and putting them into practise in the exercises.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The limitation came when I couldn't complete the last excersise in Dictionaries. But the way that I got out of it was by using previous examples to help me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week as mentioned above I am going to use previous examples to help me get through the excersises. This will help as if I repeat at the Ian parts of the previous exercises that I have done enough times it will stick in my head which will help me in future coding </td>
