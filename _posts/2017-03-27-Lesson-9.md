    <td>Today the way that we found most effective was my partner typing and me telling him what to do. Our method was very effective because it meant that we both understood the coding instead of just one of us</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of my learning in particular came when I didn't understand which part of the page I was meant to read. After a few minutes of trying to understand what I was meant to read out I found it. From this, I have realised that a good learning habit would be to re-read the text.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that I understand the code before reading it out. I will also try to understand it as well as just seeing the results. This will improve my learning because it will teach me to understand what I am doing as well as actually doing it and not knowing what I am doing.</td>
