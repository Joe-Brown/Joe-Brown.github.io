    <td>My favourite part of IT in year 8, was when my percentage went up a bit. It was a nice feeling to know that I was getting somewhere. Also, there was the competitive side which involved me trying to get past my friends. Lucky for me, seeing as they seemed to get stuck on one of the questions for a while today, I managed to speed ahead and finish with 52%.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Seeing as I joined year 8 late, one of my struggles was to catch up with everyone else. Another thing I found hard, is the actual website. At the beginning of the year, I struggled with making and personalising my github website but by the second term I was fine and ready to carry on.</td>
