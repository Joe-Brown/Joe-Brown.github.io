    <td>In this lesson the new thing that I learned was to read the instructions more than once and making sure that you haven't made any mistakes. This way you can not only check for mistakes but also try and interpret the instructions in a different way to see if that helps.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited when I got stuck on the first level that I tried to do. The solution Ifound the most helpful was by, as mentioned above, reading through the instructions again and trying to read them in a different way to before.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will do similar to what I said above but instead try and read it properly thee first time round instead of wasting time by reading it the second time round. This I will save time meaning if there are any more levels that I can't do straight away I have the time to re-read the instructions.</td>
