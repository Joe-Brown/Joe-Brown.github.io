    <td>Reading the Instructions more than once definitely helped me get through. Also, making notes on my ipad whilst the teacher explained how to get onto the work that we were doing helped me not to ask that many questions, which ultimately leads me to have more work time. </td>

    <td>I didn't work very fast and that is why I only got to 4%. I also need to work on starting to remember some of the harder things. For example I need to remember hard words like variable.</td>
