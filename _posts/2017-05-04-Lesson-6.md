    <td>Reading the hint was often helpful in order to learn. Once again I felt that when I read through the instructions thoroughly and twice then I got the answer right more often. This lesson I found that the questions, which were mostly based on code strings, were harder than last time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week the main factors that limited my learning were getting stuck on certain questions and not thinking about it properly. Another factor that limited my learning is thinking that I could just ask the teacher for help and when they did help not realising what they were saying.</td>

    <td>Next time I will work faster and work by myself so that I don't get distracted. Also, so that I catch up I will do some for homework.  In order to help myself not get distracted by certain questions then I will, of course, ask the question but this time I will think about it harder.</td>
