    <td>100% the most efficient way of learning was asking the teacher good questions. In the lesson I became extremely stuck, but when I asked the teacher a simple question. The answer was enough to jog my memory and helped me therefore reach my slightly smaller target than last lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that limited my learning was that there was only one of the teacher and 32 of us. This meant that I had to wait until he had helped loads of other students. Despite the tactic of asking for a little help being helpful, it is clear that it is not the most efficient way to work.</td>
