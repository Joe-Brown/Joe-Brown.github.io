    <td>This lesson I spent on github working on my blog. I learnt to change the transparency of the container colour. I also spent a lot of time helping my partner. This was good for me because it meant that I had to look back at what I had coded previously which therefore jogged my memory.</td>

    <td>The only problem with helping my partner and doing mostly github based work was that I didn't get any further on codecademy. (if you donâ€™t count the work I did outside of school) </td>
