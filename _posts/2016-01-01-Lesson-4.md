    <td>This week me and my partner tried something new where we set ourselves time limits on each section of code. This method worked in the way that we got the tasks done quickly. This was effective because it meant that we could get more done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leading on from the previous strategy, it did mean that we couldn't alter or try different things to see what would happen if we changed it a bit. To change this, we could either set quicker times or we could aim to do more experimenting and maybe a minutes worth less of the tasks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, my partner and I will try and speed up our timings and we will also try to add more variations, other than just the simple ones. This will improve our learning as it will encourage me to speed up and add more detail to my work. This would benefit me as I would get more detailed work done.</td>
