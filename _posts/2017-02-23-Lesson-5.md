    <td>This week me and my partner got onto a more advanced stage of the coding so it took longer, so unlike last week we took more time actually writing it instead of trying different variations but we still got through a lot of work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact the some of the code, we found, unclear as it was very precise for example some of the code had to be in capitals, but we eventually got through it by reading the script carefully and trying again. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we will try and read the code thoroughly so that we can understand the first time and that would mean that we can get through more of the work from the book. Getting more work done would benefit us at it would mean that when we get to the final stage, the robot arm, we will be able to add more dental to the code.</td>
