In this weeks lesson we learned how to write code out to make a virtual conversation. It was fun and I felt I learnt how to use all the basic functions. I also now know how to make a conversation using Repl.it. This week I used skills, including being independent in research and creativity. I was creative because a managed to create a multiple choice question. I hope to do this next week as well.
