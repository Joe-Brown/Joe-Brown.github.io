Week 11

In this lesson, we moved from making our names, into Prime numbers. We started off by writing code which would give us odd and even numbers. This code would take a number and divide it by two and if the answer was even, then it would say even. And so forth for the number being odd. Next, we moved onto trying to write the code to find a prime number. This concept was quiter hard to grasp so I hope I will understand next lesson.
