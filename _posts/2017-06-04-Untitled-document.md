**What went well:**

During the time doing the exercises I gradually put the techniques into practise. This meant that the code became a little bit easier as I went along. Also my work succeeded as I got quite a lot done.

**Challenges:**

In contrast, the challenges I faced during the time doing Codecademy were frequent but most often the same thing. This meant that I had to look out for things that might make me trip up along the way.

**What I need to work on**:

To start with what I could start doing is reading the instructions a second time for anything that might trip me up. Also, I could try to think about it logically, however this won't work in many cases.So the main thing that I will do that should help me the most is read through the instructions and think about them before I try to write out the code.
