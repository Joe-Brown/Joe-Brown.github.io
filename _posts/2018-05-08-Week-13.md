Week 13

This week we finished our questions and started writing the code for the questions. The first two or three were quite challenging to form but once we got the hang of it, It got quite easy. We had to use a lot of funtions and a lot of commands to form the code. Next week I hope to finish the questions and add anything that needs adding succesfully.
