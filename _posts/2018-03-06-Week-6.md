This week I expanded my work on the cipher code. We added ASCII code to the code. This meant that a particular code, which in this case was ASCII, will be exchanged by a simple alphabet or number. This week i used the skills of knowing how to use keyboard shortcuts, using my initiative. Next week I hope to carry on using initiative and help my friends as I didn't do much of that this week, instead my friends helped me.
