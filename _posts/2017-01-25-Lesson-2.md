    <td>In this lesson, me and my partner learnt how to change the background and text colour of our coding very quickly and easily. We also finished the first section of the Fuze Box booklet we were given.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of my learning came when my partner and I came to saving our work. Luckily, as we had two memory sticks, we didn't lose our work. Next time I am going to constantly check that both memory sticks hold the same data so that we don't struggle with saving our work.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, in my next lesson I am going to check after every line of code that our work has been saved onto both memory sticks. This habit will improve my learning because it will teach me a habit that means I won't loose my work.
