Week 7

This week, we started a new programme with a new teacher. We are now, until the further future, using a coding website called Repel.it. In this programme we are learning how to develop skills that help outside the subject. For example we are thinking for ourselves. We are also using our creative minds to try and decipher what's going on and which parts of that code we can use in the next line or for future code. Next week I am going to try and use the same skills but also try to enhance my knowledge of the code itself.
