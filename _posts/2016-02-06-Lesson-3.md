  <tr>
    <td>To learn how to create a table, I searched on the internet but the main way I found out how to do it was by asking a clever friend who knew how to do it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of my learning came when I couldn't figure out how to make the table. I think a good habit to overcome this would be to carry on asking friends if I get stuck.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ask my friends before I get stuck so that it won't stress them and me out. This will help my learning as it would mean that I will gradually teach me how to do different things, making me more independent.</td>
