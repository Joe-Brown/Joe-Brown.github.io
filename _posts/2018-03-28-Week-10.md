Week 10

This week we used our skills of making shapes to make the letters of our own name in 3d. This week was quite a bit harder as we had to continuously decide if our decision was right or wrong. I felt that in this lesson we did a lot more creative thinking than usual, but on the whole part I recognised the work as code. I felt that it is all made easier if you know the basic commands to move the turtle forward, backwards, left, right.
