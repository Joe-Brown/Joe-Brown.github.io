This week I managed to use a whole variety of skills including helping others, but the thing that I was most happy with was my work on the cipher code as I managed to complete the work, do the extension and help my friends. The cipher code involved creating a method of changing the alphabet into a series of different letters. Next week I hope I can expand on my work
