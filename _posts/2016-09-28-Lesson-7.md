    <td>When I did my work, I found reading the text twice very helpful. Once to get rid of any drowsiness, and, two to actually think it through. Also I found that unlike last time, asking for help was effective in the right places.</td>

    <td>Something that limited my learning would be that I kept on checking my percentage was unhelpful because it meant that I had less time to do the actual work.</td>
