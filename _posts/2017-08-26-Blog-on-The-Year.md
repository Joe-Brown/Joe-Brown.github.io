This year has been my first year doing coding as I also started the year in Year 8. I feel that my understanding of coding has developed quite a bit. And its not just the actual code, its also the way of using it and when to use it. Coding isn't used as much as basic Maths and English and to be honest it's not used in any other subject apart from ICT, but in the same way, it's used in lots of different ways in the actual subject.

I have also  learned that ICT provides lots of patience and also, probably more importantly team work skills. This year of ICT has helped me with both. 

Overall I think I have learned a lot in the ICT lessons and that even if the actual code does not come into my life the life skills will. I am looking forward to next year
