    <td>The way most effective way me and my partner worked this week that was different to last week was that we had to study the pictures showing where the different parts go. The different parts had to be placed carefully other wise it wouldn't have worked.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of our learning came when we couldn't quite see which holes the different part went into. The different holes on the picture were quite hard to see so we couldn't easily figure out where they went. A habit that could be used to get around this would be that we could try to ask our friends more often.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that me and my partner figure out what the pictures say a bit quicker so we have more time to actually put the pieces into the correct holes.</td>
