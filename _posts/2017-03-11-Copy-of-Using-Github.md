    <td>For this lesson me and my partner managed to get onto the light bulbs. We managed to recover pretty well after last weeks fall. We managed to write quite a lot of code and was rewarded with a light bulb flashing which was very satisfying.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The limitation of our learning came when we got onto the pieces of material. Me and my partner got confused with which hole the different wires and other materials went into. After a while we managed to figure out where they were meant to go. I think the habit I need to work on is not giving up and trying in another way.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time me and my partner will try not to give up, but instead we will keep trying to improve our skill in coding. It will also improve our mental endurance. We will also try to speed up when we get to doing our coding. Doing this will increase the amount of work we manage to complete in the lesson.</td>
