    <td>Half way through the lesson when we were just swapping over, an accidental keyboard shortcut our work got deleted. Because of this We had to re-write the code. I will learn that's should. Be more careful and check what I press before I press it.</td>

    <td>To improve my learning, next time I and my partner will look at what we press in case it backfires on us. In addition we will try to increase our speed so that we can get more work done so that we can get onto the robot arm and do that well and quickly.</td>
