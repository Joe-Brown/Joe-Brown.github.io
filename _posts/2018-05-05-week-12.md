Week 12

This week we started thinking about making our own quizzes. We started of the lesson by doing some quizzes on buzzfeed. As much as they were fun they didnt really give us the answers we were wanting most of the time. For the rest of the lesson we started coming up with our question ideas. For homework we had to finish doing the questions and figure out the scoring system.
