**Week 1**

This week we learned the basics of coding in a google sheet. We learned how to form a basic online shop. Although what we learned may not be advanced, the skills we learned today were fundamental for a base of more learning. Next week, to improve, I am going to try and complete the more advanced side of the coding and also maybe challenge myself by doing more variables and maybe more items in the shopping list.
