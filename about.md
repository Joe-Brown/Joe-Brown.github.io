### Some More Information

I play football weekly as well as doing swimming and parkour at my local lesuire center.
I started parkour a few months ago and really enjoyed the basic jumping, running and vaulting, but after 5 moths I have learned advanced methods of each of the previous categories and am even starting to learn to backflip. But so far all I have managed to do is land on my face.
