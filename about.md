### Some More Information

I play football weekly as well as doing swimming and parkour at my local lesuire center.
I started parkour a few months ago and really enjoyed the basic jumping, running and conditioning, but after 5 moths i have learned advanced methods of each of the previous categories and am even starting to learn to backflip.
